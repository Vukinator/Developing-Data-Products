# R Markdown and Leaflet (Week II Assignment)

```{r}
library(leaflet)
```
After importing leaflet, we can start with the task.
```{r}
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng= 6.14569 , lat= 46.20222, zoom= 5) %>%
  addMarkers(lng= c(6.14569 , 5.71667, 7.68682), lat= c(46.20222, 45.16667, 45.07049))
```
That's it.
