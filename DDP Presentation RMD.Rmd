# Reading in the data
```{r}
data= datasets::cars # reading the data in
```
# Making a model
```{r}
model= lm(dist~speed, data) # linear model
```
# Prediction
```{r}
speed1= 80 # hypothetical value
pred= predict(model, new.data= speed1)
```
# Plot
```{r}
plot(cars, 
     xlab = "Speed (mph)", 
     ylab = "Distance (ft)",
     bty = "n",
     xlim = c(0,200), 
     ylim = c(0,200))
abline(model, col= "blue", lwd= 1)
points(pred, col= "red")
